We're extremely happy that Restfulbrilliance.com has finally gone live!  We've got some exciting new projects on the horizon that we're looking forward to sharing with everybody.

For those of you that are interested, the site is built using a home-grown framework which cobbles together some really fantastic technologies.  Specifically:

1. Zurb Foundation
2. Jekyll
3. A build system which uses: NPM, Bower, Gulp, and Browsersync

In addition we wanted to make the framework easy to use with Visual Studio.

We are currently hoping to release a more generic version the framework that others can use it to build sites and blogs.  Look for more information to be released shortly.
